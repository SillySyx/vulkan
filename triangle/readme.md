# Draw a triangle

**Things needed**

1. Window (cross-platform)
2. Device handling (instance, physical device, logical device, validation layers, extentions)
3. Queues for submitting data (textures, index buffers .,..)
4. pipeline (swapchain, surface, images,renderpass, frames, shaders, framebuffers)
5. command pools (command buffers for each image - deferred rendering??? each command buffer specified how each framebuffer should be drawn???)

### Window Cross-platform

Well looky looky, aint we got one of them fancy cross platformy windows...
