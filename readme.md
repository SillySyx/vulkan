This repository consists of smaller samples that I use to acquaint myself the rust/vulkan world.  

For older c++ stuff check the `old_*` branches, note that most of the older stuff is in a broken state and only included for reference.  



# Getting started
You can specify which sample to run with the --bin flag.

```
cargo run --bin window-management
```
